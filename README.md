# NYTBestSellerProject

The purpose of this application is to create a tool where the user can swifty check if a book is a NYT best-seller. Additionally, the application tests the user New York Times - Best Seller knowledge with a true/false quiz regarding numerous genres and their best-seller status. 

The developers of this application utilized numerous resources including javaScript for the client-side interaction and HTML/CSS for content and presentation. The developers also referenced api from the New York Times and Google Books to ensure there was a broad range of books included. By linking a book's unique ISIN from both API feeds, the developers were able swiftly detail the best-seller status of a book. 

The developers hope users will utilize the "try-again" function as a means of improving their high score and NYT Best-Seller status. Additionally, we would like our users to understand that just because a book is a NYT Best-Seller, does not mean it is a quality read!
